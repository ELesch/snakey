## Task

{One-line description of what needs to be implemented}

## Files to Modify

|------|--------|--------|
| `{path}` | Create | {why} |
| `{path}` | Modify | {why} |
| `{path}` | Delete | {why} |

## Reference Files

Files containing patterns the coding agent should follow:

- `{path}` - {what pattern to use from this file}
- `{path}` - {what pattern to use from this file}

## Test Patterns

Where similar tests exist:

- `{path}` - {test pattern to follow}

## Critical Context

## Anti-Context

Do NOT:
